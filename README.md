#### MongoDB structure

The MongoDB structure utlized is: Two collections, Anime and Users.

Reference data model was utilized instead of the traditional embeded data model due to a couple of factors: scalability, query optimzition, query readablility. Especially since future plans of anime user statistics (how many people have added an anime to a watchlist), will be implemented eventually leading to the decision of a reference model.

### Usage

Add animes to your watchlist.
